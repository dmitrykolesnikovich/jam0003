## x86-art
a basic "interpreter" for assembly-style instructions written in ascii art


# How to use
Download the repo, `cargo run` the project and pass whatever file as an argument

# Disclaimer
i joined the jam late, and wasn't available to work on it for very long. I wanted to at least submit something, so this is what I came up with. as such, the code will be extremely horrendous, and the instruction set will be very limited
